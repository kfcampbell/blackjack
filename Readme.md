This is a simple BlackJack game I made just for fun. I know, I know, it's not scalable or clean. In fact, it's probably the worst thing I've ever written. Please don't hate me.

Currently only supports four cards per hand with no splitting of hands.

Storyboards are only calibrated for iPhone 5s. Please contact me at kfcampbell@scu.edu if you'd like expanded form factor support.
